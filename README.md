### Hi, I am Stuti Sharma! (she/her) 👋

🌐 Currently enhancing my skills with the MERN stack for building web applications. While I have some experience, I’m actively improving and mastering it.

🛠️ Proficient in C++, with some experience in Java and Python.

💡 I'm expanding my skills further:
- Learning about blockchain technology and its applications.
- Keen to explore Go (Golang) further and improve my skills, as I find its simplicity and performance truly fascinating.
- Machine Learning is on my learning horizon.

- ♟️ In my spare time, I enjoy a good game of chess and occasionally dive into a good book. Music is my go-to for relaxation.
